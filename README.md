# Running the website and other info

Clone the repo and run "npm start". 

Then open a new terminal and run "npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000".

If project is cloned without node_modules, change directory into the folder and do a "npm install" in terminal.

Currently the website only has basic functionalities like viewing blogs, adding new ones and deleting them. Also one extra feature is dark mode option. Thats the slider on top right without any context. There are no plans deploying this and will only be ranned localy.
